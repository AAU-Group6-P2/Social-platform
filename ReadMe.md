Moodle-Extension Clubs Events

A web-based platform developed as a Moodle extension prototype where stu-
dents can explore and join clubs and events, while club owners can create and
manage club activities.

The project is built using a multi-page architecture with a Node.js and Ex-
press.js backend connected to a Supabase PostgreSQL database.

  2. Navigate to the backend folder: cd social-platform/backend
  3. Install dependencies: npm install

Environment Variables
Create a .env file inside the backend/ folder. Add the following variable:
  • SUPABASE SERVICE KEY=your supabase service key

  1. Start the server: npm start or node server.js
  2. The server will run locally on: http://localhost:3000

Development Mode
To run the project using nodemon: npm run dev
Backend Architecture
The backend follows a modular Express.js architecture based on separation of
concerns.

The system is divided into:
  • routes → endpoint definitions
  • controllers → application logic
  • middleware → reusable authorization logic
  • Supabase configuration → centralized database connection
  
This structure improves:
  • maintainability
  • scalability
  • readability
  • separation between routing and business logic
  
Database Design
The application uses Supabase with a PostgreSQL relational database.
Main database tables:
  • users
  • clubs
  • events
  • club members
  • event joined

The system uses relational connections and junction tables to manage:
  • users joining clubs
  • users joining events
Foreign key constraints ensure relational integrity between entities.

Authentication & Sessions
The application uses a simplified session-based authentication system using
express-session. Instead of traditional email/password authentication:
  • users are assigned a UUID
  • users select a role (student or club owner)
  • sessions maintain user state during navigation
  
This approach was chosen because the system is designed as a Moodle exten-
sion, where authentication would normally be handled externally.

Image Uploads
Club images are uploaded using:
  • Multer for handling file uploads
  • Supabase Storage for cloud-based image storage
Uploaded image URLs are stored in the database and linked to the correspond-
ing club.

API Structure
The backend follows REST-inspired routing principles using standard HTTP
methods.
